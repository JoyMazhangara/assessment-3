    <h1>My Skills</h1>
    <p>Let's start with the professional matters and then get to the fun stuff
       shall we? I believe skills are a good to have in life, they usually are acquired 
       through repeated practice and not to be confused with talent. Here are some of mine:
    </p>
	    <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
			<li>Leadership</li>
			<li>Public Speaking</li>
			<li>Interpersonal Skills</li>
            <li>Time Management</li>
			<li>Conflict Management</li>
		</ul>

    <h1>My Interests</h1>
    <p>Now we're getting closer to the good stuff! My interests span a wide variety 
       of creative outlets. I grew up being both creative and logical. For instance,
       I took AP Studio Art and AP Bio concurrently during high school! Here are just
       a few of my interests:
    </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Dancing</li>
            <li>Graphic Design/Drawing</li>
            <li>Singing</li>
            <li>Roller-skating</li>
            <li>Reading</li>
            <li>Jesus</li>
        </ul>

    <h1>My Career Goals</h1>
    <p>We have arrived at the good stuff! My career goals aren't very traditional. Working a 9-5 isn't the life for me, I would
       like to have both time and money in the same equation. I've discovered that building my own small 
       business will allow me to. My career goal is to build my current small business
       into an ongoing source of income so I can go on to:
    </p>
        <ul style="list-style-type:disc">
            <li>Infuse who I am in all I do </li>
            <li>Impact the world!</li>
            <li>Shine my light!</li>
        </ul>
