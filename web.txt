How does the internet work?
    From what I have learned during the module, I understand 
    the internet to be a series of connections sending information 
    to and forth. You can break down how the internet works by thinking
    of three computers lined up from front to back in front of you. 
    The computer closest to you is the front-end interface used by
    people to access the internet (i.e. phone, tablet, laptop, etc.). The computer
    behind it is a 'server' which sifts through information it recieves
    and directs it to the appropriate place in the third computer, the 'database.'
    The database stores vasts amount of information (think of long-term memory) while
    the server keeps information for a shorter amount of time.

What happens when you click a link?
    From what I have learned during this module, when you
    click a link on a site it sends a request to a server. 
    Once the server recieves the request it parses through the 
    type of data being requested and sources where to get it. Once
    that data is retrieved from a back-end database it parsed
    through the server and presented back to the front-end user 
    requesting it. Clicking a link essential fires a series of actions
    to happen behind the scenes between two other computers.
